# VisitingPE Project

This is a multipage app made for educational purposes as the first assignment of EvolveU FullStack Developer Program.

The focus is to create a web app using HTTP APIs with Javascript and ExpressJS. I used GET and POST methods and served HTML pages as user interface. 

## Getting Started

1. Fork this repository, then clone your fork of this repository.
2. Install dependencies using the `npm install` command.
3. Start the web server using the `npm start` command. The app will be served at <http://localhost:3000/>.
4. Go to <http://localhost:3000/> in your browser.
